Overview and Scope


Project Title – Airbnb vs Hotels: Where will you stay?  

Team Members – Omar Farag, Mary Phillipuk, Huma Ghiya, Halak Patel

Project Description/Outline
We will analyze Airbnb and hotel listing data for 8 world cities to compare price and review ratings for each lodging type per location. We will compare difference between each city, as well as differences from neighborhood to neighborhood within a single city. We will look for trends and factors affecting lodging price and rating, and ultimately consider where it is better to stay.

Research Questions to Answer:
1)	Where is it better to stay in terms of price and review score, Airbnb or Hotel?
2)	How do lodging prices/ratings differ from city to city, or between neighborhoods in the same city?
3)	How do hotel and Airbnb locations compare, and how does location affect price?
4)	What factors influence people to choose a particular lodging?
5)	What trends may we find in the data?
6)  What else can be considered when assessing which is better, Airbnb or Hotel?

1)	Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html )

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1)	Identifying Data Sources
2)	Cleaning the Data
3)	Data Exploration and Analysis
4)	Formulating Story
5)	Assemble Presentation Materials
6)	Prepare for Presentation and Q&A
